   just the instance of `duper` that was able to prove the goal. -/

/- In this example, `duper` can't solve the original goal on its own, but if `ring` is used to handle
   handle some of the arithmetic and provide just the right lemma, `duper` can get the rest. -/

/- This problem will cause Duper to print the message: "Duper determined that this problem requires
   inhabitation reasoning, continuing portfolio mode with it enabled." Since Duper proceeds to solve
   the goal afterwards with a different portfolio instance, no further action needs to be taken. However,
   if Duper went on to fail, rerunning Duper with the `inhabitationReasoning` option set to true
   could be fruitful since Duper would then know to not waste any time on portfolio instances where
   `inhabitationReasoning` is disabled. -/

  duper [Injective, *]

/- Attempting to call `duper` directly on the original goal will fail because it isn't able to generate a
   counterexample to Surjf on its own. But if we provide the counterexample, `duper` can solve from there. -/
